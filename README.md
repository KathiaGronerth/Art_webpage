🎨 Art Webpage — Artist Portfolio Website (Personal Project)
(JavaScript, React, CSS, Responsive UI)

I designed and developed a responsive portfolio website for a visual artist, focused on showcasing artwork in a clean, modern layout optimized for both desktop and mobile. The project highlights my ability to combine user-centric design with frontend engineering and product-thinking.

🔑 Key Responsibilities

- Designed the full UI/UX to highlight artwork visually while keeping navigation simple, intuitive, and minimalistic.
- Developed the website using React, implementing reusable components for the gallery, navigation, and art details.
- Built a dynamic gallery layout with modal pop-ups, smooth transitions, and image enlargement for better visual appreciation.
- Implemented responsive design ensuring seamless display and performance across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
- Collaborated closely with the artist to translate creative requirements into technical features (color palette, typography, structure).
- Optimized page load performance, image rendering, and accessibility considerations.
- Deployed the site and structured the codebase for easy maintenance and future content updates.
